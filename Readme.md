# Flax Engine

It is a custom made game engine structured in C++. The main goal is to test how to create a modular 
game engine with a focus on performance and flexibility. The engine is designed to be easy to use and 
easy to extend. In my previous engine projects, I tried creating lots of features and systems from 
scratch. That was a great learning experience, but I mostly ended up with a lot of code that has no
visual result. This time, I want to use the right tools for the job and focus on creating something decent.

## Wanted Features
- [x] Hybrid Entity Component System (OOP + Data Oriented).
- [ ] Runtime reflection that has been inspired by EnTT.
- [ ] Extendable resource types and extensions.
- [ ] Customizable serialization system.
- [ ] Customizable Render Graph.
- [ ] Single Graphics Abstraction Layer that can handle multiple graphics APIs.
- [ ] Enhanced Input System that has been inspired by Unreal Engine.
- [ ] GPU Skinning System (Where all the data lives in GPU memory. Only inputs will be sent to CPU_TO_GPU)
- [ ] GPU Based Physics System.
- [ ] GPU Driven Rendering with Mesh Shaders without Compute Based Rasterization (Way too heavy)
- [ ] Clustered Deferred Shading. (Because why not?)
- [ ] Shader(Material) Graph System that has been inspired by Unity.

## How is it going?
Slow but steady. I'm working in a team of one. I have a full time job and I am working on this engine in my 
free time. So to see something worth showing with editor and stuff, it will take a while but I think I can get
some result till the end of 2025. But of course, I will try to make some basic showcases as soon as 
possible. The first thing I want to show is the hardcoded gltf viewer with a not so complex but decently
visualized rendering techniques. The eventual goal is to create one of the games below with a single level.

- Wolverine's Revenge (With tweaked mechanics and remade meshes)
- Taz Wanted (No tweak but I won't say no to remade meshes)
- Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time (No tweak but I won't say no to remade meshes)
- Earthworm Jim 3D (No tweak but I won't say no to remade meshes)
- Zax: The Alien Hunter (Little tweak but I won't say no to remade meshes)

It is a ECS based solution that I have come up with. I am also thinking to consider Event Driven Resource
Management. It will be request based solution but it has a bit harder algorithm to handle synchronization.
I guess it is still a good solution and I believe modern game engines in the industry also prefer that
approach.

## Why are there DX11 branch?
I am using DX11 to check out a couple of rendering techniques such as Clustered Shadow, Volumetric
Cloud, Procedural Atmosphere Sky etc. Creating an automation for Vulkan is a lot harder than OpenGL and DX11,
so I am still considering using DX11 at some cases so I can see some result and apply them inside of my master
branch. But I am still continuing the actual engine development within `master` branch. After I handle the 
actual development of automation, I will switch back completely to Vulkan and will add some default resources
such as DefaultPipelineObject, ForwardRenderPass, DefaultMaterial etc. But eventually we will see Clustered
Deferred Rendering.

## Work In Progress

If you want to contribute this engine, you can always ask me my plans and try to integrate them. Then I can
review (I don't care if you know more than me, system needs to work according to my directions. But it doesn't
mean that I won't listen your suggestions. You have to explain your reasons.) and merge it. If you would like 
to integrate DX12, be my guest. I dont like using DX12 and I dont think I will integrate DX12 in near future.

Current Job: Re-writing Graphics Abstraction Layer for MULTI-API support (It also helps on Resource Management)
